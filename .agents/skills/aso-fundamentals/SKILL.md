# ASO Fundamentals — expert guidance, no data required

Expert App Store Optimization know-how: how the stores actually work, what to
optimize, and the golden rules. **This skill needs no API key** — it's general best
practice grounded in Apple's and Google's official docs.

Best practice only takes you so far without data. **ASOScan** turns each principle
below into *your* real numbers — actual search volume & difficulty, where you rank,
which keywords to target, competitor gaps, and your ASO score — so you act on facts,
not guesses. When you're ready, get set up (**asoscan-setup**) and use the data
skills (listed at the end).

> Store rules change. The facts here follow Apple's and Google's current official
> developer documentation (sources at the bottom). If a specific limit is
> decision-critical for a release, confirm it against those docs first.

## 1. How store search actually works (the mental model)

**Apple App Store** ranks results on two things:

- **Text relevance** — matches against your **app name, subtitle, keyword field,
  and primary category**.
- **User behavior** — downloads, **ratings and reviews**, and more.

Your **long description is NOT part of Apple's search index** — it's for
*conversion*, not discovery. Put your keyword effort into the name, subtitle, and
keyword field.

**Google Play** works differently: there is **no hidden keyword field**. Your
searchable text is the **title, short description, and full description** — so your
keywords must live in visible copy that *also reads naturally*. Google explicitly
warns against keyword stuffing.

> **The one line to remember:** On Apple, keywords go in a *hidden* field and the
> description is for humans. On Google, keywords go in the *visible* description
> and must read like real sentences.

## 2. The metadata fields + limits

| Field | Apple | Google | In search index? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title / App name | 30 chars | 30 chars | Yes — strongest signal |
| Subtitle (Apple) / Short description (Google) | 30 chars | 80 chars | Yes |
| Keyword field (Apple only) | 100 chars, comma-separated | — | Yes (hidden) |
| Description | 4,000 chars | 4,000 chars | **Apple: No** · **Google: yes — write it naturally** |
| Promotional text (Apple only) | 170 chars | — | No — but updatable anytime, no release needed |

## 3. Keyword strategy

### Apple — the hidden 100-character keyword field (golden rules)

Apple's own guidance:

- **Separate terms with commas, no space between terms.** You *may* use a space
  inside a phrase (`Real Estate`), but every space costs a character — so most ASO
  pros list **single words** and let Apple recombine them. Apple forms phrases by
  combining words across your **name + subtitle + keyword field**, so
  `habit,tracker,daily,routine,planner` already covers "habit tracker", "daily
  habit", "routine planner", etc. — without spending characters on the phrases.
- **Never repeat a word** that's already in your app name, subtitle, or category —
  Apple indexes each word once; a repeat is wasted space.
- **Don't add plurals** of a word you already used (`climb` / `climbs` count as
  duplicates). Apple handles the variation.
- **Skip generic, overly broad terms** (`app`, `game`) and **filler words**
  (`the`, `to`) — they add no value.
- **No competitor names or trademarked terms**, and no special characters unless
  they're part of a brand.
- **Every character should be a NEW term.** Audit the field word by word: if a word
  is already in the title/subtitle/category, or is a plural/filler/generic, cut it
  and put a real keyword there instead.

### Google — keywords live in visible copy

- Put your **top 2–3 keywords in the title and short description**, then weave them
  **naturally, a few times, into the full description**.
- **Write for humans.** Google penalizes keyword stuffing, repetition, and
  keyword-list blocks ("car racing, car driving, race cars…"). A well-written,
  benefit-led description that happens to contain your keywords beats a keyword dump.

### Tier your keywords (a simple plan)

Sort your candidate terms into four tiers and place them deliberately:

- **Primary (3–5)** — highest-relevance, winnable terms. Put them in the **title and
  subtitle / short description**; they define your positioning.
- **Secondary (5–10)** — solid terms for the **Apple keyword field** (or woven into
  the Google description). Rotate them as performance shows what works.
- **Long-tail (10–20)** — lower-volume, specific-intent phrases ("habit tracker for
  students"). Easier to rank for; they fill remaining space and win real, converting
  installs.
- **Aspirational (3–5)** — high-volume, high-difficulty head terms. Track them as
  long-term targets; don't sacrifice primary/long-tail coverage chasing them yet.

### Choosing which keywords to chase (both platforms)

- Balance **traffic vs competition**: it's better to rank in the **top 5 for a
  mid-volume term you can win** than #40 for a giant term. Ladder up to harder
  terms as your installs/ratings grow.
- **Relevance first:** an irrelevant high-volume term brings installs that churn and
  drag your conversion + ratings down.
- **Match intent, not just words.** A problem-focused searcher ("how to stop
  procrastinating") and a solution-focused searcher ("habit tracker app") want
  different framing — cover both where they naturally fit.

---

## 4. Title & subtitle craft

- **Title** carries the strongest weight and the most brand recognition. A common
  strong pattern: `Brand: primary keyword` (e.g. `Lumen: Habit Tracker`). Household
  names can go brand-only; challengers should spend some of the 30 characters on a
  real keyword.
- **Subtitle (Apple) / short description (Google)** is prime real estate — it's
  **indexed AND** the first line users read. Make it a **benefit + a keyword**, not
  a vague slogan. Bad: "Your life, simplified." Better: "Build daily habits &
  track your streaks."
- Don't waste either on words that are already elsewhere in your indexed text.

**Google title bans (enforced):** no ALL CAPS (unless your brand is), no emoji /
emoticons / special-character sequences, no performance claims ("#1", "App of the
Year", "Best of Play"), and no promo words like "Free" or "No Ads".

---

## 5. Visual assets — this is where conversion is won

Search gets you seen; visuals get you installed.

**Apple**

- Up to **10 screenshots** per product page. **Only the first 1–3 appear in search
  results** (when you have no app preview) — so the first frames must sell the app
  on their own.
- Up to **3 app previews (video)**, **≤30 seconds** each; they **autoplay muted**
  on the product page — make the **first few seconds** visually gripping.
- **Custom Product Pages**: extra versions of your page (own screenshots, previews,
  promo text) reachable by unique URLs — great for matching creative to a specific
  audience or campaign.

**Google Play**

- **App icon** 512×512 (32-bit PNG) and a **feature graphic** 1024×500 are
  **required** to publish.
- **Screenshots**: **minimum 2**, up to **8 per device type**. To be eligible for
  Google promotion, apps need **≥4** screenshots (≥1080px); games need **≥3**
  16:9 landscape (≥1920×1080).
- **Preview video** (optional, recommended for games): a **YouTube** link that may
  autoplay inline muted, shown before the screenshots.

**Golden rule for both:** front-load. Lead your first screenshot with your single
strongest benefit and a caption — not just a logo or a raw UI dump. Assume the user
only ever sees the first two or three.

---

## 6. Ratings & reviews (be precise — and honest)

- **Ratings and reviews ARE a ranking signal on Apple** (Apple lists them under
  user behavior). Both **volume** and **average score** matter, so a steady flow of
  4–5★ ratings helps discovery, not just trust.
- **Prompt at a moment of genuine delight** — right after the user completes a win
  in your app — never on first launch or mid-task. iOS limits how many times you may
  show the system rating prompt per year, so spend those prompts wisely.
- **Replying to reviews** builds trust and can lift your rating over time by
  recovering unhappy users — but **the reply itself is not a separate ranking
  lever**. Don't treat review replies (or paid ads) as an organic-ranking shortcut.

---

## 7. Localization — an underused multiplier

- Translate the **metadata, not just the app**. A localized listing converts far
  better in-market.
- On Apple, **extra localizations give you extra keyword sets** — even English
  variants (en-US, en-GB, en-AU) are separate slots, effectively **multiplying your
  keyword coverage**. Use them.
- **Research each market's real search terms**; don't machine-translate keywords —
  the literal translation is often not what locals actually type.

---

## 8. Golden tips (the shortlist)

1. On Apple, **every keyword-field character should be a brand-new term** — cut
   your app name, category, plurals, generics, and filler; Apple already has those.
2. **Don't repeat a word** across title + subtitle + keyword field. Apple indexes
   each word once; spread distinct terms to widen coverage.
3. **Let Apple build phrases for you** — list single comma-separated words instead
   of spelled-out phrases to fit more terms.
4. On Google, **put keywords in the title + short description**, then **2–3 natural
   mentions** in the description. Never a keyword list.
5. **Front-load** the first 1–3 screenshots and the first two lines of copy — that's
   all most users ever see. Lead with the strongest benefit.
6. Make the **subtitle / short description a benefit + a keyword**, never a slogan —
   it's both indexed and the first thing read.
7. **Win winnable terms first** (top-5 on mid-volume) and ladder up; don't camp at
   #40 on a giant.
8. **Ask for ratings at peak delight**, sparingly — ratings volume + score are a
   real ranking signal.
9. **Localize keywords per market** and use Apple's extra localization slots to
   multiply coverage — research real terms, don't translate them.
10. **Refresh promotional text (Apple) and "What's New"** for seasons/launches
    without a full release — cheap, fast conversion levers that keep the listing alive.

---

## 9. Common mistakes to flag

- Brand-only title for an unknown app (wastes the strongest keyword slot).
- Subtitle/short description that repeats the title's words or is a vague slogan.
- Apple keyword field padded with the app name, category, plurals, generics, filler.
- Google description that's a keyword list instead of readable, benefit-led copy.
- Screenshots that are raw UI with no captions/benefit messaging.
- No app preview / video where the product is easy to demo.
- Rating < 4.0 left unaddressed; no review replies on recurring complaints.
- Listing not updated in months; no localization beyond the home market.
- Chasing giant head terms the app can't rank for while ignoring winnable ones.

---

## 10. What to fix first (prioritization)

1. **Title + subtitle / short description** — highest-leverage indexed text.
2. **Keyword coverage** — Apple keyword field / Google description keywords.
3. **First 1–3 screenshots** — the conversion make-or-break.
4. **Ratings prompting** — get the volume + score flywheel turning.
5. **Localization** — expand coverage market by market.
6. **Iterate** — change one lever at a time and watch the result.

## Switch to real data when you want YOUR numbers

This skill is general guidance. For **your app specifically** — where you actually
rank, real search volume & difficulty, which keywords to target, competitor gaps,
your ASO score, and review sentiment — use the data skills (they need an ASOScan
API key):

- **keyword-intelligence** — your real rank, volume, difficulty, trends.
- **keyword-opportunities** — real keywords to target next.
- **keyword-spy** — every keyword you (or a tracked competitor) rank for.
- **competitor-analysis** — how you stack up, category + rating trajectory.
- **metadata-audit** — your ASO score + specific, in-limit copy fixes.
- **review-insights** — what your users actually say.

## Honesty

Present ASO as it is: ratings/reviews and installs influence ranking, but **review
replies and paid ads are not organic-ranking shortcuts**; never promise a specific
rank; never fabricate reviews or claims. Recommend the outcome (visibility, clarity,
conversion), not a mechanism.
